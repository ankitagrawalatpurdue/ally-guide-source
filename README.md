# Ally.Guide Overview
Ally.guide is a web app hoping to support and strengthen racial justice movements against policy brutality by guiding folx to become better allies by: educating, donating, activating policies, and collaborating with existing orgs through services.

## About the Project
### Educate:
- How to guides for antiracism (showing up to protests, talking to family members, etc)
- FAQâ€™s (what questions do you think would be helpful here?)
- Toolbox of articles, essays, and online pdfs that outline history of antiblackness and why it matters.
- Healing tools
- Current events by state

### Donate (Biggest priority, please help with data labelling):
- Racial Justice oriented orgs
- Task Forces (Bail Funds, Supply funds, etc on the ground)
- Families affected
- Helping black owned businesses

### Activate:
- Query representatives, Email templates that can be sent directly (referencing petitions)
- Call tracks
- Petitions to sign and follow

### Collaborate:
- Public Demos
- What are projects we can add to (raheem.ai, antipoliceterrorproject, etc)?
- Form for volunteers to offer services

As we set up infrastructure, we could really use your help to help populate these fields with current updates. This is a people movement, please let us know what could be made better and where we should expand.
